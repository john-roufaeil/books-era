This is a simple Networks project in which I had to learn on my own how to use Node.js and Express.js to manipulate client/server connection and keeping track of short-termed database-like system using a JSON file.

Please note that this project was part of a course in which they provided the user interface, i.e., I was only responsible for the back-end of this project.

You can use a live version of the project  <a href="https://booksera.onrender.com/" target="_blank">here</a>
